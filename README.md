# Stew Garbage Collector
C and C++ Garbage Collector

Welcome to Stew!

Watch our 1 minute introductory video on how to use this fast-and-free garbage collector here! 

Stew GC is a multi-threaded fast garbage collector implemented using the portable C++17 standard runtime.

The name S-T-e-W comes from Stop-The-World, a requirement of this garbage collector. In short, it requires that all objects be frozen for a brief amount of time, a process called Parallel Marking. Our approach features multi-producer lock-free structures and never any locks.
